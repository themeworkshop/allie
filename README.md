# allie

Allie is a base stylesheet intended to provide basic, opinonated and accessible defaults for starting a project or using as a fallback style for legacy browsers. It is opinionated and builds upon the defaults set by [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

## Installing with npm

`npm install @themeworkshop/allie`

## Contributing

The project uses a number of PostCSS plugins to make maintaining the stylesheet easier.
The stylesheet in the source directory is compiled to the dist directory using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).

`npm run build` will run the build process once.

`npm start` will run the build process and allow it to continue watching for subsequent changes to the source code.

Examples of the styles should be visible in the html file in the example directory.
